This paper addresses the gap in the widespread adoption of drift detection techniques by proposing a serverless-based approach for batch covariate drift detection in ML systems. Leveraging the open-source OSCAR framework and the open-source Frouros drift detection library, we develop a set of services that enable parallel execution of two key components: the ML inference pipeline and the batch covariate drift detection pipeline. To this end, our proposal takes advantage of the elasticity and efficiency of serverless computing for ML pipelines, including scalability, cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration with existing infrastructure. We evaluate this approach through an edge ML use case, showcasing its operation on a simulated batch covariate drift scenario. Our research highlights the importance of integrating drift detection as a fundamental requirement in developing robust and trustworthy AI systems and encourages the adoption of these techniques in ML deployment pipelines. In this way, organizations can proactively identify and mitigate the adverse effects of covariate drift while capitalizing on the benefits offered by serverless computing.&amp;#34;,\n    addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (JCR 2023): 6.2&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2024.07.010&amp;#34;,\n    keywords = &amp;#34;Serverless computing, Machine learning, Drift detection, Covariate drift, Covariate shift&amp;#34;,\n    url = &amp;#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X24003716&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

Federated learning is a technology in the field of privacy-preserving machine learning techniques that has revolutionized the current state of the art, evolving from classical centralized approaches to allow training models in a decentralized way, without sharing raw data. In this work, we present the production implementation of a federated learning system based on the Flower framework that allows users, without a technological background, to exploit this technique, performing federated learning training within the AI4EOSC platform. The objective is to be able to train this type of architecture in an intuitive way; for this purpose, a user-friendly dashboard has been implemented, whose development will be reviewed. The frameworks and technologies used for this implementation will be exposed together with an example of use from scratch, in order to demonstrate the use of this functionality of the platform.

For anomaly-based detection, the dynamic definition of thresholds has gained importance and attention in detecting abnormalities and preventing malicious activities. Unlike conventional threshold-based methods, deep learning data modeling provides a more nuanced perspective on network monitoring. This enables security systems to continually refine and adapt to the evolving situation in streaming data online, which is also our goal.

In this work, with the concept of data-driven soft-sensing, three hydrophysical features are used together with three meteorological ones to estimate the concentration of Chl in two tributaries of the River Thames. Data driven models, specifically neural networks, are used with three learning approaches: individual, centralized and federated. Data reduction scenarios are proposed in order to analyze the performance of each approach when less data is available. The best results in the training are usually obtained with the individual approach. However, the federated learning provides better generalization ability.

Specifically, a use case of medical image analysis is proposed, using chest X-ray images obtained from an open data repository. In addition to the advantages related to privacy, improvements in predictions (in terms of accuracy, loss and area under the curve) and reduction of execution times will be studied with respect to the classical case (the centralized approach). Different clients will be simulated from the training data, selected in an unbalanced manner. The results of considering three or ten clients are exposed and compared between them and against the centralized case. Two different problems related to intermittent clients are discussed, together with two approaches to be followed for each of them. Specifically, this type of problems may occur because in a real scenario some clients may leave the training, and others enter it, and on the other hand because of client technical or connectivity problems.

Firstly, using only incidence data, we trained machine learning models and adjusted classical ODE-based population models, especially suited to capture long term trends. As a novel approach, we then made an ensemble of these two families of models in order to obtain a more robust and accurate prediction. We then proceed to improve machine learning models by adding more input features: vaccination, human mobility and weather conditions. However, these improvements did not translate to the overall ensemble, as the different model families had also different prediction patterns. Additionally, machine learning models degraded when new COVID variants appeared after training. We finally used Shapley Additive Explanation values to discern the relative importance of the different input features for the machine learning models’ predictions. The conclusion of this work is that the ensemble of machine learning models and population models can be a promising alternative to SEIR-like compartmental models, especially given that the former do not need data from recovered patients, which are hard to collect and generally unavailable.&amp;#34;,\n    addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (JCR 2022): 4.6&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;10.1038/s41598-023-33795-8&amp;#34;,\n    refid = &amp;#34;Heredia Cacha2023&amp;#34;,\n    url = &amp;#34;https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33795-8&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

In this document we present the implementation of pyCANON, a Python library and command line interface (CLI) to check and assess the level of anonymity of a dataset through some of the most common anonymization techniques: k-anonymity, (α,k)-anonymity, ℓ-diversity, entropy ℓ-diversity, recursive (c,ℓ)-diversity, t-closeness, basic β-likeness, enhanced β-likeness and δ-disclosure privacy. For the case of more than one sensitive attribute, two approaches are proposed for evaluating these techniques. The main strength of this library is to obtain a full report of the parameters that are fulfilled for each of the techniques mentioned above, with the unique requirement of the set of quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes. The methods implemented are presented together with the attacks they prevent, the description of the library, examples of the different functions’ usage, as well as the impact and the possible applications that can be developed. Finally, some possible aspects to be incorporated in future updates are proposed.&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;10.1038/s41597-022-01894-2&amp;#34;,\n    refid = &amp;#34;Sáinz-Pardo Díaz2022&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

Given the resource-intensive nature of these models, they often need to be executed on specialized hardware such graphical processing units (GPUs) in a distributed manner. In the academic field, researchers get access to this kind of resources through High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. This kind of infrastructures make the training of these models difficult due to their multi-user nature and limited user permission. In addition, different HPC clusters may possess different peculiarities that can entangle the research cycle (e.g., libraries dependencies). In this paper we develop a workflow and methodology for the distributed training of deep learning models in HPC clusters which provides researchers with a series of novel advantages. It relies on udocker as containerization tool and on Horovod as library for the distribution of the models across multiple GPUs. udocker does not need any special permission, allowing researchers to run the entire workflow without relying on any administrator. Horovod ensures the efficient distribution of the training independently of the deep learning framework used. Additionally, due to containerization and specific features of the workflow, it provides researchers with a cluster-agnostic way of running their models. The experiments carried out show that the workflow offers good scalability in the distributed training of the models and that it easily adapts to different clusters.&amp;#34;,\n    addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (JCR 2021): 2.303&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;10.1007/s10586-022-03798-7&amp;#34;,\n    refid = &amp;#34;González-Abad2022&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

Traditionally, batch systems have allowed data centers to fill their resources as much as possible by using backfilling and similar techniques. However, in an IaaS cloud, where virtual machines are supposed to live indefinitely, or at least as long as the user is able to pay for them, these policies are not easily implementable. In this work we present a new scheduling algorithm for IaaS providers that is able to support preemptible instances, that can be stopped by higher priority requests without introducing large modifications in the current cloud schedulers. This scheduler enables the implementation of new cloud usage and payment models that allow more efficient usage of the resources and potential new revenue sources for commercial providers. We also study the correctness and the performance overhead of the proposed scheduler against existing solutions.&amp;#34;,\n    addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (JCR 2019): 6.125&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;10.1016/j.future.2018.12.057&amp;#34;,\n    keywords = &amp;#34;Cloud computing, Scheduling, Preemptible instances, Spot instances, Resource allocation&amp;#34;,\n    owner = &amp;#34;alvaro&amp;#34;,\n    timestamp = &amp;#34;2019.01.14&amp;#34;,\n    url = &amp;#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X1830270X&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

The project has provided e-infrastructures with tools, applications and cloud framework enhancements to manage the demanding requirements of scientific communities, either locally or through enhanced interfaces. The middleware developed allows to federate hybrid resources, to easily write, port and run scientific applications to the cloud. In particular, we have extended existing PaaS (Platform as a Service) solutions, allowing public and private e-infrastructures, including those provided by EGI, EUDAT, and Helix Nebula, to integrate their existing services and make them available through AAI services compliant with GEANT interfederation policies, thus guaranteeing transparency and trust in the provisioning of such services. Our middleware facilitates the execution of applications using containers on Cloud and Grid based infrastructures, as well as on HPC clusters. Our developments are freely downloadable as open source components, and are already being integrated into many scientific applications.&amp;#34;,\n    addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (JCR 2018): 3.288&amp;#34;,\n    day = &amp;#34;07&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;10.1007/s10723-018-9453-3&amp;#34;,\n    owner = &amp;#34;alvaro&amp;#34;,\n    timestamp = &amp;#34;2018.08.10&amp;#34;,\n    url = &amp;#34;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10723-018-9453-3&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

The Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD) and Cloud Middleware Distribution (CMD) are the channels to deliver the software for the EGI e-Infrastructure consumption. The software is compiled, validated and distributed following the Software Provisioning Process (SWPP), where the Quality Criteria (QC) definition sets the minimum quality requirements for EGI acceptance. The growing number of software components currently existing within UMD and CMD distributions hinders the application of the traditional, manual-based validation mechanisms, thus driving the adoption of automated solutions. This paper presents umd-verification, an open-source tool that enforces the fulfillment of the QC requirements in an automated way for the continuous validation of the software products for scientific disposal. The umd-verification tool has been successfully integrated within the SWPP pipeline and is progressively supporting the full validation of the products in the UMD and CMD repositories. While the cost of supporting new products is dependant on the availability of Infrastructure as Code solutions to take over the deployment and high test coverage, the results obtained for the already integrated products are promising, as the time invested in the validation of products has been drastically reduced. Furthermore, automation adoption has brought along benefits for the reliability of the process, such as the removal of human-associated errors or the risk of regression of previously tested functionalities.&amp;#34;,\n    addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (JCR 2018): 3.288&amp;#34;,\n    day = &amp;#34;1&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;10.1007/s10723-018-9454-2&amp;#34;,\n    owner = &amp;#34;alvaro&amp;#34;,\n    timestamp = &amp;#34;2018.08.14&amp;#34;,\n    url = &amp;#34;https://doi.org/10.1007/s10723-018-9454-2&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

Local Resource Management Systems (LRMS) have been used in data centers for decades in order to obtain the best usage of the resources, providing their fair usage and partitioning for the users. In contrast, current cloud schedulers are normally based on the immediate allocation of resources on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that a request will fail if there are no resources (e.g. OpenStack) or it will be trivially queued ordered by entry time (e.g. OpenNebula). Moreover, these scheduling strategies are based on a static partitioning of the resources, meaning that existing quotas cannot be exceeded, even if there are idle resources allocated to other projects. This is a consequence of the fact that cloud instances are not associated with a maximum execution time and leads to a situation where the resources are under-utilized. These facts have been identified by the INDIGO-DataCloud project as being too simplistic for accommodating scientific workloads in an efficient way, leading to an underutilization of the resources, a non desirable situation in scientific data centers. In this work, we will present the work done in the scheduling area during the first year of the INDIGO project and the foreseen evolutions.&amp;#34;,\n    addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (SJR 2016): 0.240&amp;#34;,\n    archiveprefix = &amp;#34;arXiv&amp;#34;,\n    arxivid = &amp;#34;1707.06403&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;10.1088/1742-6596/898/9/092010&amp;#34;,\n    eprint = &amp;#34;1707.06403&amp;#34;,\n    file = &amp;#34;:home/alvaro/Mendeley/Garcia et al. - 2017 - Improved Cloud resource allocation how INDIGO-DataCloud is overcoming the current limitations in Cloud schedulers.pdf:pdf&amp;#34;,\n    url = &amp;#34;http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/898/i=9/a=092010 http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06403&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

This overhead becomes larger for requests composed of several virtual machines to be started concurrently, and the illusion of flexibility and elasticity usually associated with the cloud computing model may vanish. This poses a problem for both the resource providers and the software developers, since tackling those overheads is not a trivial issue. In this work we implement and evaluate several improvements for virtual machine image distribution problem in a cloud infrastructure and propose a method based on BitTorrent and local caching of the virtual machine images that reduces the transfer time when large requests are made.&amp;#34;,\n    Addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (JCR 2016): 3.500&amp;#34;,\n    Doi = &amp;#34;10.1016/j.jnca.2015.10.015&amp;#34;,\n    File = &amp;#34;:home/alvaro/.local/share/data/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/López García, Fernández del Castillo - 2016 - Efficient image deployment in cloud environments.pdf:pdf&amp;#34;,\n    ISSN = &amp;#34;10848045&amp;#34;,\n    Keywords = &amp;#34;Cloud computing,Image deployment,OpenStack,Scheduling&amp;#34;,\n    Url = &amp;#34;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1084804516000382&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

The EGI Cloud technology enables the federation of institutional clouds to run scientists workloads, simulations and services spanned across multiple administrative locations, allowing the users to access and exploit its resources as a unique system. The architecture of the federation was defined after a two year period of development based on a set of user stories describing operations on a cloud infrascturues and was officially launched in May 2014. Since then the EGI Federated Cloud operates as a federation of heterogeneous Infrastructure as a Service type clouds with every participating provider implementing the same set of interfaces towards users and system administrators. Enforcing cloud technology agnosticism and of supporting service mobility by means of open standards has also allowed for the inclusion of commercial cloud providers into an infrastructure previously supported only by academic institutions. This contributes to a wider goal of the funders to create economic and social impact from supported research activities.

The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 10 34 cm −2 s −1 (10 27 cm −2 s −1 ). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4$\pi$ solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|$\eta$| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.&amp;#34;,\n    addendum = &amp;#34;Journal impact factor (JCR 2008): 0.821&amp;#34;,\n    doi = &amp;#34;10.1088/1748-0221/3/08/S08004&amp;#34;,\n    file = &amp;#34;:home/alvaro/.local/share/data/Mendeley Ltd./Mendeley Desktop/Downloaded/Collaboration et al. - 2008 - The CMS experiment at the CERN LHC.pdf:pdf&amp;#34;,\n    url = &amp;#34;http://stacks.iop.org/1748-0221/3/i=08/a=S08004&amp;#34;\n}\n');">Bibtex</a>&nbsp;] -->

Such an infrastructure implies high availability, performance and robustness resulting in a much larger management effort than in traditional grid environments which are usually targeted to run sequential non-interactive applications. To achieve these goals the int.eu.grid project offers advanced brokering mechanisms and user friendly graphical interfaces supporting application steering.

    abstract = "In cybersecurity, live production data for predictive analysis pose a significant challenge due to the inherently secure nature of the domain. Although there are publicly available, synthesized, and artificially generated datasets, authentic scenarios are rarely encountered. For anomaly-based detection, the dynamic definition of thresholds has gained importance and attention in detecting abnormalities and preventing malicious activities. Unlike conventional threshold-based methods, deep learning data modeling provides a more nuanced perspective on network monitoring. This enables security systems to continually refine and adapt to the evolving situation in streaming data online, which is also our goal. Furthermore, our work in this paper contributes significantly to AIOps research, particularly through the deployment of our intelligent module that cooperates within a monitoring system in production. Our work addresses a crucial gap in the security research landscape toward more practical and effective secure strategies.",

This has become even more important with the rise of artificial intelligence techniques through the training of machine learning and deep learning models. In this sense, the AI4EOSC project aims to respond to this need by delivering an enhanced set of advanced services and tools for the development of artificial intelligence, machine and deep models, such as federated learning, in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). Federated learning is a technology in the field of privacy-preserving machine learning techniques that has revolutionized the current state of the art, evolving from classical centralized approaches to allow training models in a decentralized way, without sharing raw data. In this work, we present the production implementation of a federated learning system based on the Flower framework that allows users, without a technological background, to exploit this technique, performing federated learning training within the AI4EOSC platform. The objective is to be able to train this type of architecture in an intuitive way; for this purpose, a user-friendly dashboard has been implemented, whose development will be reviewed. The frameworks and technologies used for this implementation will be exposed together with an example of use from scratch, in order to demonstrate the use of this functionality of the platform. Finally, two scenarios concerning client availability are analyzed.",

    abstract = "As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in production, robust monitoring and detection of concept and covariate drift become critical. This paper addresses the gap in the widespread adoption of drift detection techniques by proposing a serverless-based approach for batch covariate drift detection in ML systems. Leveraging the open-source OSCAR framework and the open-source Frouros drift detection library, we develop a set of services that enable parallel execution of two key components: the ML inference pipeline and the batch covariate drift detection pipeline. To this end, our proposal takes advantage of the elasticity and efficiency of serverless computing for ML pipelines, including scalability, cost-effectiveness, and seamless integration with existing infrastructure. We evaluate this approach through an edge ML use case, showcasing its operation on a simulated batch covariate drift scenario. Our research highlights the importance of integrating drift detection as a fundamental requirement in developing robust and trustworthy AI systems and encourages the adoption of these techniques in ML deployment pipelines. In this way, organizations can proactively identify and mitigate the adverse effects of covariate drift while capitalizing on the benefits offered by serverless computing.",

Firstly, using only incidence data, we trained machine learning models and adjusted classical ODE-based population models, especially suited to capture long term trends. As a novel approach, we then made an ensemble of these two families of models in order to obtain a more robust and accurate prediction. We then proceed to improve machine learning models by adding more input features: vaccination, human mobility and weather conditions. However, these improvements did not translate to the overall ensemble, as the different model families had also different prediction patterns. Additionally, machine learning models degraded when new COVID variants appeared after training. We finally used Shapley Additive Explanation values to discern the relative importance of the different input features for the machine learning models’ predictions. The conclusion of this work is that the ensemble of machine learning models and population models can be a promising alternative to SEIR-like compartmental models, especially given that the former do not need data from recovered patients, which are hard to collect and generally unavailable.",

Specifically, a use case of medical image analysis is proposed, using chest X-ray images obtained from an open data repository. In addition to the advantages related to privacy, improvements in predictions (in terms of accuracy, loss and area under the curve) and reduction of execution times will be studied with respect to the classical case (the centralized approach). Different clients will be simulated from the training data, selected in an unbalanced manner. The results of considering three or ten clients are exposed and compared between them and against the centralized case. Two different problems related to intermittent clients are discussed, together with two approaches to be followed for each of them. Specifically, this type of problems may occur because in a real scenario some clients may leave the training, and others enter it, and on the other hand because of client technical or connectivity problems. Finally, improvements and future work in the field are proposed.",

However, with the existing sensor technology, measurement in real-time and with enough frequency to ensure proper risk management is not completely feasible. In this work, with the concept of data-driven soft-sensing, three hydrophysical features are used together with three meteorological ones to estimate the concentration of Chl in two tributaries of the River Thames. Data driven models, specifically neural networks, are used with three learning approaches: individual, centralized and federated. Data reduction scenarios are proposed in order to analyze the performance of each approach when less data is available. The best results in the training are usually obtained with the individual approach. However, the federated learning provides better generalization ability. It was also observed that in most of the cases the results of the federated learning approach improve those of the centralized one.",

    abstract = "Deep learning has been postulated as a solution for numerous problems in different branches of science. Given the resource-intensive nature of these models, they often need to be executed on specialized hardware such graphical processing units (GPUs) in a distributed manner. In the academic field, researchers get access to this kind of resources through High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. This kind of infrastructures make the training of these models difficult due to their multi-user nature and limited user permission. In addition, different HPC clusters may possess different peculiarities that can entangle the research cycle (e.g., libraries dependencies). In this paper we develop a workflow and methodology for the distributed training of deep learning models in HPC clusters which provides researchers with a series of novel advantages. It relies on udocker as containerization tool and on Horovod as library for the distribution of the models across multiple GPUs. udocker does not need any special permission, allowing researchers to run the entire workflow without relying on any administrator. Horovod ensures the efficient distribution of the training independently of the deep learning framework used. Additionally, due to containerization and specific features of the workflow, it provides researchers with a cluster-agnostic way of running their models. The experiments carried out show that the workflow offers good scalability in the distributed training of the models and that it easily adapts to different clusters.",

For the case of more than one sensitive attribute, two approaches are proposed for evaluating these techniques. The main strength of this library is to obtain a full report of the parameters that are fulfilled for each of the techniques mentioned above, with the unique requirement of the set of quasi-identifiers and sensitive attributes. The methods implemented are presented together with the attacks they prevent, the description of the library, examples of the different functions’ usage, as well as the impact and the possible applications that can be developed.

Traditionally, batch systems have allowed data centers to fill their resources as much as possible by using backfilling and similar techniques. However, in an IaaS cloud, where virtual machines are supposed to live indefinitely, or at least as long as the user is able to pay for them, these policies are not easily implementable. In this work we present a new scheduling algorithm for IaaS providers that is able to support preemptible instances, that can be stopped by higher priority requests without introducing large modifications in the current cloud schedulers. This scheduler enables the implementation of new cloud usage and payment models that allow more efficient usage of the resources and potential new revenue sources for commercial providers. We also study the correctness and the performance overhead of the proposed scheduler against existing solutions.",

    abstract = "Supporting e-Science in the EGI e-Infrastructure requires extensive and reliable software, for advanced computing use, deployed across over approximately 300 European and worldwide data centers. The Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD) and Cloud Middleware Distribution (CMD) are the channels to deliver the software for the EGI e-Infrastructure consumption. The software is compiled, validated and distributed following the Software Provisioning Process (SWPP), where the Quality Criteria (QC) definition sets the minimum quality requirements for EGI acceptance. The growing number of software components currently existing within UMD and CMD distributions hinders the application of the traditional, manual-based validation mechanisms, thus driving the adoption of automated solutions. This paper presents umd-verification, an open-source tool that enforces the fulfillment of the QC requirements in an automated way for the continuous validation of the software products for scientific disposal. The umd-verification tool has been successfully integrated within the SWPP pipeline and is progressively supporting the full validation of the products in the UMD and CMD repositories. While the cost of supporting new products is dependant on the availability of Infrastructure as Code solutions to take over the deployment and high test coverage, the results obtained for the already integrated products are promising, as the time invested in the validation of products has been drastically reduced. Furthermore, automation adoption has brought along benefits for the reliability of the process, such as the removal of human-associated errors or the risk of regression of previously tested functionalities.",

The project has provided e-infrastructures with tools, applications and cloud framework enhancements to manage the demanding requirements of scientific communities, either locally or through enhanced interfaces. The middleware developed allows to federate hybrid resources, to easily write, port and run scientific applications to the cloud. In particular, we have extended existing PaaS (Platform as a Service) solutions, allowing public and private e-infrastructures, including those provided by EGI, EUDAT, and Helix Nebula, to integrate their existing services and make them available through AAI services compliant with GEANT interfederation policies, thus guaranteeing transparency and trust in the provisioning of such services. Our middleware facilitates the execution of applications using containers on Cloud and Grid based infrastructures, as well as on HPC clusters. Our developments are freely downloadable as open source components, and are already being integrated into many scientific applications.",

    abstract = "Performing efficient resource provisioning is a fundamental aspect for any resource provider. Local Resource Management Systems (LRMS) have been used in data centers for decades in order to obtain the best usage of the resources, providing their fair usage and partitioning for the users. In contrast, current cloud schedulers are normally based on the immediate allocation of resources on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that a request will fail if there are no resources (e.g. OpenStack) or it will be trivially queued ordered by entry time (e.g. OpenNebula). Moreover, these scheduling strategies are based on a static partitioning of the resources, meaning that existing quotas cannot be exceeded, even if there are idle resources allocated to other projects. This is a consequence of the fact that cloud instances are not associated with a maximum execution time and leads to a situation where the resources are under-utilized. These facts have been identified by the INDIGO-DataCloud project as being too simplistic for accommodating scientific workloads in an efficient way, leading to an underutilization of the resources, a non desirable situation in scientific data centers. In this work, we will present the work done in the scheduling area during the first year of the INDIGO project and the foreseen evolutions.",

This overhead becomes larger for requests composed of several virtual machines to be started concurrently, and the illusion of flexibility and elasticity usually associated with the cloud computing model may vanish. This poses a problem for both the resource providers and the software developers, since tackling those overheads is not a trivial issue. In this work we implement and evaluate several improvements for virtual machine image distribution problem in a cloud infrastructure and propose a method based on BitTorrent and local caching of the virtual machine images that reduces the transfer time when large requests are made.",

The EGI Cloud technology enables the federation of institutional clouds to run scientists workloads, simulations and services spanned across multiple administrative locations, allowing the users to access and exploit its resources as a unique system. The architecture of the federation was defined after a two year period of development based on a set of user stories describing operations on a cloud infrascturues and was officially launched in May 2014. Since then the EGI Federated Cloud operates as a federation of heterogeneous Infrastructure as a Service type clouds with every participating provider implementing the same set of interfaces towards users and system administrators. Enforcing cloud technology agnosticism and of supporting service mobility by means of open standards has also allowed for the inclusion of commercial cloud providers into an infrastructure previously supported only by academic institutions. This contributes to a wider goal of the funders to create economic and social impact from supported research activities.

The infrastructure capacity is presently about 750 cpu cores distributed over twelve sites in seven countries. These resources have to be tightly coordinated to match the requirements of parallel computing. Such an infrastructure implies high availability, performance and robustness resulting in a much larger management effort than in traditional grid environments which are usually targeted to run sequential non-interactive applications. To achieve these goals the int.eu.grid project offers advanced brokering mechanisms and user friendly graphical interfaces supporting application steering. The int.eu.grid environment is deployed on top of the gLite middleware enabling full interoperability with existing gLite based infrastructures.",

    abstract = "The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is described. The detector operates at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. It was conceived to study proton-proton (and lead-lead) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV (5.5 TeV nucleon-nucleon) and at luminosities up to 10 34 cm −2 s −1 (10 27 cm −2 s −1 ). At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4$\pi$ solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|$\eta$| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.",
