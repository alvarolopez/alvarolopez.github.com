  abstract      = {Performing efficient resource provisioning is a fundamental aspect for any resource provider. Local Resource Management Systems (LRMS) have been used in data centers for decades in order to obtain the best usage of the resources, providing their fair usage and partitioning for the users. In contrast, current cloud schedulers are normally based on the immediate allocation of resources on a first-come, first-served basis, meaning that a request will fail if there are no resources (e.g. OpenStack) or it will be trivially queued ordered by entry time (e.g. OpenNebula). Moreover, these scheduling strategies are based on a static partitioning of the resources, meaning that existing quotas cannot be exceeded, even if there are idle resources allocated to other projects. This is a consequence of the fact that cloud instances are not associated with a maximum execution time and leads to a situation where the resources are under-utilized. These facts have been identified by the INDIGO-DataCloud project as being too simplistic for accommodating scientific workloads in an efficient way, leading to an underutilization of the resources, a non desirable situation in scientific data centers. In this work, we will present the work done in the scheduling area during the first year of the INDIGO project and the foreseen evolutions.},

  Abstract                 = {The biggest overhead for the instantiation of a virtual machine in a cloud infrastructure is the time spent in transferring the image of the virtual machine into the physical node that executes it. This overhead becomes larger for requests composed of several virtual machines to be started concurrently, and the illusion of flexibility and elasticity usually associated with the cloud computing model may vanish. This poses a problem for both the resource providers and the software developers, since tackling those overheads is not a trivial issue. In this work we implement and evaluate several improvements for virtual machine image distribution problem in a cloud infrastructure and propose a method based on BitTorrent and local caching of the virtual machine images that reduces the transfer time when large requests are made.},

The EGI Cloud technology enables the federation of institutional clouds to run scientists workloads, simulations and services spanned across multiple administrative locations, allowing the users to access and exploit its resources as a unique system. The architecture of the federation was defined after a two year period of development based on a set of user stories describing operations on a cloud infrascturues and was officially launched in May 2014. Since then the EGI Federated Cloud operates as a federation of heterogeneous Infrastructure as a Service type clouds with every participating provider implementing the same set of interfaces towards users and system administrators. Enforcing cloud technology agnosticism and of supporting service mobility by means of open standards has also allowed for the inclusion of commercial cloud providers into an infrastructure previously supported only by academic institutions. This contributes to a wider goal of the funders to create economic and social impact from supported research activities. This paper details the state of the art, the design and development processes, and the organisational effort that have lead to the creation and deployment of the EGI Cloud Platform.},

At the core of the CMS detector sits a high-magnetic-field and large-bore superconducting solenoid surrounding an all-silicon pixel and strip tracker, a lead-tungstate scintillating-crystals electromagnetic calorimeter, and a brass-scintillator sampling hadron calorimeter. The iron yoke of the flux-return is instrumented with four stations of muon detectors covering most of the 4$\pi$ solid angle. Forward sampling calorimeters extend the pseudorapidity coverage to high values (|$\eta$| ≤ 5) assuring very good hermeticity. The overall dimensions of the CMS detector are a length of 21.6 m, a diameter of 14.6 m and a total weight of 12500 t.},

The middleware developed allows to federate hybrid resources, to easily write, port and run scientific applications to the cloud. In particular, we have extended existing PaaS (Platform as a Service) solutions, allowing public and private e-infrastructures, including those provided by EGI, EUDAT, and Helix Nebula, to integrate their existing services and make them available through AAI services compliant with GEANT interfederation policies, thus guaranteeing transparency and trust in the provisioning of such services. Our middleware facilitates the execution of applications using containers on Cloud and Grid based infrastructures, as well as on HPC clusters. Our developments are freely downloadable as open source components, and are already being integrated into many scientific applications.},

  abstract  = {Supporting e-Science in the EGI e-Infrastructure requires extensive and reliable software, for advanced computing use, deployed across over approximately 300 European and worldwide data centers. The Unified Middleware Distribution (UMD) and Cloud Middleware Distribution (CMD) are the channels to deliver the software for the EGI e-Infrastructure consumption. The software is compiled, validated and distributed following the Software Provisioning Process (SWPP), where the Quality Criteria (QC) definition sets the minimum quality requirements for EGI acceptance. The growing number of software components currently existing within UMD and CMD distributions hinders the application of the traditional, manual-based validation mechanisms, thus driving the adoption of automated solutions. This paper presents umd-verification, an open-source tool that enforces the fulfillment of the QC requirements in an automated way for the continuous validation of the software products for scientific disposal. The umd-verification tool has been successfully integrated within the SWPP pipeline and is progressively supporting the full validation of the products in the UMD and CMD repositories. While the cost of supporting new products is dependant on the availability of Infrastructure as Code solutions to take over the deployment and high test coverage, the results obtained for the already integrated products are promising, as the time invested in the validation of products has been drastically reduced. Furthermore, automation adoption has brought along benefits for the reliability of the process, such as the removal of human-associated errors or the risk of regression of previously tested functionalities.},

Traditionally, batch systems have allowed data centers to fill their resources as much as possible by using backfilling and similar techniques. However, in an IaaS cloud, where virtual machines are supposed to live indefinitely, or at least as long as the user is able to pay for them, these policies are not easily implementable. In this work we present a new scheduling algorithm for IaaS providers that is able to support preemptible instances, that can be stopped by higher priority requests without introducing large modifications in the current cloud schedulers. This scheduler enables the implementation of new cloud usage and payment models that allow more efficient usage of the resources and potential new revenue sources for commercial providers. We also study the correctness and the performance overhead of the proposed scheduler against existing solutions.},

  abstract      = {Deep learning has been postulated as a solution for numerous problems in different branches of science. Given the resource-intensive nature of these models, they often need to be executed on specialized hardware such graphical processing units (GPUs) in a distributed manner. In the academic field, researchers get access to this kind of resources through High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. This kind of infrastructures make the training of these models difficult due to their multi-user nature and limited user permission. In addition, different HPC clusters may possess different peculiarities that can entangle the research cycle (e.g., libraries dependencies). In this paper we develop a workflow and methodology for the distributed training of deep learning models in HPC clusters which provides researchers with a series of novel advantages. It relies on udocker as containerization tool and on Horovod as library for the distribution of the models across multiple GPUs. udocker does not need any special permission, allowing researchers to run the entire workflow without relying on any administrator. Horovod ensures the efficient distribution of the training independently of the deep learning framework used. Additionally, due to containerization and specific features of the workflow, it provides researchers with a cluster-agnostic way of running their models. The experiments carried out show that the workflow offers good scalability in the distributed training of the models and that it easily adapts to different clusters.},

In this paper we present theoretical aspects about federated learning, such as the presentation of an aggregation operator, different types of federated learning, and issues to be taken into account in relation to the distribution of data from the clients, together with the exhaustive analysis of a use case where the number of clients varies. Specifically, a use case of medical image analysis is proposed, using chest X-ray images obtained from an open data repository. In addition to the advantages related to privacy, improvements in predictions (in terms of accuracy, loss and area under the curve) and reduction of execution times will be studied with respect to the classical case (the centralized approach). Different clients will be simulated from the training data, selected in an unbalanced manner. The results of considering three or ten clients are exposed and compared between them and against the centralized case. Two different problems related to intermittent clients are discussed, together with two approaches to be followed for each of them. Specifically, this type of problems may occur because in a real scenario some clients may leave the training, and others enter it, and on the other hand because of client technical or connectivity problems. Finally, improvements and future work in the field are proposed.},
