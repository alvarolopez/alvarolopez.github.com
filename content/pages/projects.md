| [![ai4eosc](/static/ai4eosc.png "AI4EOSC logo") <br /> AI4EOSC](http://ai4eosc.eu) <br /> (Project Coordinator)     | AI4EOSC will deliver an advanced AI and data science plaform (providing enhancements like distributed and federated learning, privacy and anonimity tools, composite AI, etc.) in the context of the European Open Science Cloud, building on the roots of the [DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud project](https://deep-hybrid-datacloud-eu) | Sep 2022 - Aug 2025 |
| [![iMagine](/static/imagine.png "iMagine logo") <br /> iMagine](https://imagine.eu)      | iMagine provides a portfolio of ‘free at point of use’ image datasets, high-performance image analysis tools empowered with Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Best Practice documents for scientific image analysis. These services and materials enable better and more efficient processing and analysis of imaging data in marine and freshwater research, accelerating our scientific insights about processes and measures relevant for healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters. iMagine will exploit the [DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud project](https://deep-hybrid-datacloud-eu) services existing in the EOSC Compute Platform       | Sep 2022 - Aug 2025 |
| [![I4C](/static/i4c.png "I4C logo") <br /> Impetus4Change](#) | The overarching objective of I4C is to improve the quality, accessibility and usability of near-term climate information and services at local to regional scales to strengthen and support end-user adaptation planning and action. I4C will commit to Open Science through development of open access tools and exploitation of data/model outputs via relevant platforms thereby ensuring improved accessibility and usability of climate knowledge in the context of the EOSC. | _Coming Soon_      |
| [![CDS](/static/cds.png "CDS logo") <br /> CDS Modernization](#) | The Copernicus Data Store (CDS) Modernization will provide state-of-the-art technologies for the current CDS operated nby ECMWF, resulting in a more robust infrastructure and services. | |
| [![EGI-ACE](/static/egi-ace.png "EGI ACE logo") <br /> EGI-ACE](https://www.egi.eu/projects/egi-ace/) | EGI-ACE empowers researchers from all disciplines to collaborate in data- and compute-intensive research across borders through free at point of use services. Building on the distributed computing integration in EOSC-hub, it delivers the EOSC Compute Platform and contributes to the EOSC Data Commons through a federation of Cloud compute and storage facilities, PaaS services and data spaces with analytics tools and federated access services. | |
