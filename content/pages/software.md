(disclaimer: not updated information!)

## Cloud stuff

All the stuff I contributed or I have developed can be found on my
[personal git repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/alvarolopez),
our [GitHub group organization](https://github.com/IFCA)
or on our [GitLab instance](https://gitlab.ifca.es).

- I am one of the maintainers of several integration components used by the
  OpenStack resource providers in the
  [EGI Federated Cloud](https://www.egi.eu/infrastructure/cloud/):
    - [cASO](https://github.com/IFCA/caso/), an accounting extractor, used to
      collect the OpenStack records and send it to the EGI accounting
      infrastructure.
    - [atrope](https://github.com/alvarolopez/atrope), a tool to fetch and sync VM image lists from the EGI AppDB.
    - (deprecated) [ooi](http://github.com/openstack/ooi), an [OCCI](http://occi-wg.org/) interface for OpenStack (ooi stands for OpenStack OCCI Interface).
    - (deprecated) [VOMS authentication module](https://ifca.github.io/keystone-voms) for Keystone.
    - (deprecated) [VOMS authentication plugin](https://github.com/IFCA/voms-auth-system-openstack)
      for novaclient.
    - (deprecated) [Cloud BDII provider](https://github.com/EGI-FCTF/cloud-bdii-provider).
- I was an ATC (Active Technical Contributor) for [OpenStack](https://openstack.org) in the past.

## Useful things

- Some [LaTeX Beamer templates](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aalvarolopez+beamer) that I use.
- [GGUS Report generator](https://github.com/alvarolopez/ggus_report_generator) for generating GGUS reports for NGI_IBERGRID, that can be used for other NGIs as well.
