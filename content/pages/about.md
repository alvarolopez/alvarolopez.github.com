## Cloud stuff

All the stuff I contributed or I have developed can be found on my [personal
git repositories on Github](https://github.com/alvarolopez).

- I am one of the maintainers of several integration components used by the
  OpenStack resource providers in the
  [EGI Federated Cloud](https://www.egi.eu/infrastructure/cloud/):
    - [cASO](https://github.com/IFCA/caso/), an accounting extractor, used to
      collect the OpenStack records and send it to the EGI accounting
      infrastructure.
    - [ooi](http://github.com/openstack/ooi), an [OCCI](http://occi-wg.org/) interface for OpenStack (ooi stands for OpenStack OCCI Interface).
    - [VOMS authentication module](https://ifca.github.io/keystone-voms) for Keystone.
    - [VOMS authentication plugin](https://github.com/IFCA/voms-auth-system-openstack)
      for novaclient.
    - [Cloud BDII provider](https://github.com/EGI-FCTF/cloud-bdii-provider).
- I am an ATC (Active Technical Contributor) for
  [OpenStack](https://openstack.org), although not as much as I'd like. I have
  been a contributor for other OpenStack projects as well.
- I helped to maintain the [OCCI](https://occi-wg.org) interface for OpenStack.


## Useful things

- Some [LaTeX Beamer templates](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aalvarolopez+beamer) that I use.
- [GGUS Report generator](https://github.com/alvarolopez/ggus_report_generator) for generating GGUS reports for NGI_IBERGRID, that can be used for other NGIs as well.
