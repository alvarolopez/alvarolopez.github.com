I am a staff researcher (_Científico Titular_) at the
[Advanced Computing and e-Science Group](https://computing.ifca.es) of the
[Institute of Physics of Cantabria (IFCA)](http://www.ifca.es), associated with the
[Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](http://www.csic.es).

This page is kept deliberately simple. This means no complicated JavaScript
(the only script used is on the [publications page](/publications.html), no
large images (black and white when possible), no fancy effects. There are no
tracking cookies, no analytics, no social media buttons, or any kind of
fingerprinting scripts. [We do not need any of that to build websites](https://drewdevault.com/2018/09/04/Conservative-web-development.html).

## Research

### Topics

 * Cloud computing models, distributed systems, advanced computing (with
   special focus on research and science services).
 * Security and privacy.
 * Data science (with focus on security, privacy, ethics and trustworthiness)
 * Socially, environmentally responsible and ethical computing (especially on
   data-driven science, but not only).

### Publications

You can find a list of my publications [here](/publications.html) or in any of my public profiles:

 * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=18bi2PEAAAAJ), probably the most up to date listing.
 * [ORCID 0000-0002-0013-4602](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0013-4602), probably the most accurate listing.
 * [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/2066875/alvaro-lopez-garcia/).
 * [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/135/6079.html).

### Projects

You can check my current and past projects [here](/projects.html). Currently I
am mostly working on distributed computing (Cloud) services for science (with a
focus on data sciecne) in the context of the [European Open Science
Cloud](https://www.eosc.eu).

### Infrastructure

I coordinate the [computing (Cloud, batch, HPC, storage)
infrastructure](https://confluence.ifca.es/display/IC/Computing+Resources) and
services that our group is operating. These resources are focused on scientific
users and researchers, providing specialized compute and storage services.

## Teaching

I am the responsible of the _Security, privacy and legal aspects_ subject
([UIMP](http://www.uimp.es/postgrado/estudios/fichaasig.php?plan=P04A&any=2021-22&asi=102277&dis=2&lan=en),
[UC](https://web.unican.es/estudios/detalle-asignatura?c=M1976&p=205)) of the
[Data Science Master](https://masterdatascience.ifca.es/index_en.html) from the
[University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es) and the
[International University Menéndez Pelayo](https://uimp.es). You can find all the materials in [Moodle](https://moodle.unican.es). Also, I normally offer a few [TFM (_Trabajo de Fin de Máster)](https://masterdatascience.ifca.es/tfm.html).

### PhD students

I am currently supervising the following PhD students:

 * Aida Palacio Hoz (working towards improved Intrusion Detection Systems, IDS).
 * Judith Sainz-Pardo Díaz (working on privacy aspects of data science).
 * Jaime Céspedes Sisniega (working on MLOps techniques).
 * Ignacio Heredia Cacha (working on resource and placement optimizations for compute services).
