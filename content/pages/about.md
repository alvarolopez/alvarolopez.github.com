I am a staff researcher (_Científico Titular_) at the
[Advanced Computing and e-Science Group](https://computing.ifca.es) of the
[Institute of Physics of Cantabria (IFCA)](http://www.ifca.es), associated with the
[Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](http://www.csic.es).

## Research

### Topics

 * Cloud computing models, distributed systems, advanced computing (with
   special focus on research and science services).
 * Security and data privacy.
 * Data science (with focus on security, privacy, ethics and trustworthiness)
 * Socially, environmentally responsible and ethical computing (especially on
   data-driven science, but not only).

### Publications

You can find a list of my publications [here](/publications.html) or in any of my public profiles:

 * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=18bi2PEAAAAJ), probably the most up to date listing.
 * [ORCID 0000-0002-0Y013-4602](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0013-4602), probably the most accurate listing.
 * [Publons](https://publons.com/researcher/2066875/alvaro-lopez-garcia/).
 * [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pid/135/6079.html).

### Projects

You can check my current and past projects [here](/projects.html). Currently I
am mostly working on distributed computing (Cloud) services for science (with a
focus on data sciecne) in the context of the [European Open Science
Cloud](https://www.eosc.eu).

### Infrastructure

I coordinate the [computing (Cloud, batch, HPC, storage)
infrastructure](https://confluence.ifca.es/display/IC/Computing+Resources) and
services that [our group](https://computing.ifca.es) is operating. These
resources are focused on scientific users and researchers, providing
specialized compute and storage services.

## Teaching

I am the responsible of the _Security, privacy and legal aspects_ subject
([UIMP](http://www.uimp.es/postgrado/estudios/fichaasig.php?plan=P04A&any=2021-22&asi=102277&dis=2&lan=en),
[UC](https://web.unican.es/estudios/detalle-asignatura?c=M1976&p=205)) of the
[Data Science Master](https://masterdatascience.ifca.es/index_en.html) from the
[University of Cantabria](https://web.unican.es) and the
[International University Menéndez Pelayo](https://uimp.es). You can find all the materials in [Moodle](https://moodle.unican.es). Also, I normally offer a few [TFM (_Trabajo de Fin de Máster_)](https://masterdatascience.ifca.es/tfm.html).

### PhD students

I am currently supervising the following PhD students:

 * Aida Palacio Hoz (working towards improved Intrusion Detection Systems, IDS).
 * Judith Sainz-Pardo Díaz (working on privacy aspects of data science).
 * Jaime Céspedes Sisniega (working on MLOps techniques).
 * Ignacio Heredia Cacha (working on resource and placement optimizations for compute services).

## Short bio

Alvaro Lopez Garcia, PhD, ([ORCID 0000-0002-0Y013-4602](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0013-4602))
is a CSIC Tenured
Scientist (_Científico Titular_)
[Advanced Computing and e-Science Group](https://computing.ifca.es) of the
[Institute of Physics of Cantabria (IFCA)](http://www.ifca.es), associated with the
[Spanish National Research Council (CSIC)](http://www.csic.es) (IFCA, CSIC-UC).

His main research interests are focused on the implementation,
development and promotion of advanced computing services for science and
research, exploiting distributed infrastructures over the computing
continuum (i.e. Cloud and Edge computing, High Performance Computing,
etc.). Some of the tools, services and platforms that have been
developed in this regard are being used in pan-European production
e-Infrastructures (like the EGI.eu Compute Service) or are being
exploited by end users in the context of the European Open Science Cloud
(EOSC).

He has participated in more than 20 EU projects (FP7, Horizon 2020,
Horizon Europe); noteworthy being the technical coordinator of iMagine
and coordinating the H2020 DEEP-Hybrid-DataCloud and the Horizon Europe
AI4EOSC actions, all of them focused on delivering advanced and
innovative services for artificial intelligence over the EOSC.

<!-- He is the representative of CSIC in the EOSC AISBL (the association signed a -->
<!-- Memorandum of Understanding with the European Commission to progress the EOSC -->
<!-- partnership), co-chair of the EOSC Task Force on Technical Interoperability of -->
<!-- Data and Services (since 2021), co-chair of the EGI Artificial Intelligence -->
<!-- technology coordination board (since 2021) and the CSIC representative in the -->
<!-- Science Europe EOSC Task Force. He is also a CSIC Vocal in the Centro de -->
<!-- Supercomputación de Galicia (CESGA) Advisory Committee and the CSIC -->
<!-- representative in the Spanish Network of Open e-Science (Red Española de -->
<!-- e-Ciencia abierta). -->
