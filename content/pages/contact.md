## Email

The best way to reach me is through email at [aloga@ifca.unican.es](mailto:aloga@ifca.unican.es).

I receive a lot of email, therefore I need some time to digest it. Please be aware that [email is an asynchronous communication channel](/posts/2021/03/23/working-remotely-asynchronous-vs-synchronous-communications/).

## GPG key

Please note that I have changed my GPG key in order to use a 4096-bit long RSA
key.

 * My GPG key ID is [`0x5570F717`](http://pgp.rediris.es/pks/lookup?search=0x5570F717&fingerprint=on&hash=on&op=vindex).
 * My GPG key fingerprint is `DD1E 52B5 DACB F2B6 FFFC  98D2 3D98 5711 5570 F717`.
 You should not trust this without further verification.

You can also find me and verify my identity on
[keybase.io](https://keybase.io/aloga), where you can download my
[public key](https://keybase.io/aloga/key.asc).

### Old GPG key
