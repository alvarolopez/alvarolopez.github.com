## GPG key

Please note that I have changed my GPG key in order to use a 4096-bit long RSA
key. My old key is still valid, but will be revoked in the near furture.

 * My GPG key ID is [`0x5570F717`](http://pgp.rediris.es/pks/lookup?search=0x5570F717&fingerprint=on&hash=on&op=vindex).
 * My GPG key fingerprint is `DD1E 52B5 DACB F2B6 FFFC  98D2 3D98 5711 5570 F717`.
 You should not trust this without further verification.

You can also find me and verify my identity on
[keybase.io](https://keybase.io/aloga), where you can download my
[public key](https://keybase.io/aloga/key.asc).

### Old GPG key

My **OLD** GPG key had the ID [`0x50738AE3`](http://pgp.rediris.es/pks/lookup?search=0x50738AE3&fingerprint=on&hash=on&op=vindex),
with fingerprint `1C3F 3E63 CC6F B57D 7895  03A9 C663 E404 5073 8AE3`. This key
was a 1024-bit long, therefore I have started its removal. It will be revoked sooner or later.
